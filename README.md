## Project Details
Creating a new project is time consuming. As developers, we spend more time bootstrapping projects instead of adding functionality. Sunrise is tackling this problem by helping developers easily get up and running without worrying about the build configuration.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bsheikh/sunrise.git <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
$ yarn install
$ yarn run start:dev
Server is now running at http://localhost:4000.
```

## Deployment
`[npm|yarn] run deploy:prod` creates a `dist` directory with a production build of your app. Set HTTP server to serve index.html and the application will load.

### Static Server
For environments using Node, install `serve` and let it handle the rest.
```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
More Information: [https://github.com/zeit/serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)

### S3 Deploy
1. Navigate to the S3 service and click `Create Bucket`. Make up a clever name for your new bucket, then click `Create`.
1. Click on the newly-created bucket. Within the `Properties`, open the `Static Website Hosting` tab, and select `Enable website hosting`. Fill in `index.html` for both the Index and Error Documents. By setting `index.html` as the Error Document, we can allow something like react-router to handle routes outside of the root.
1. Add the contents of your `dist` directory to this bucket. This can be done by clicking on the bucket and clicking `Upload`. Thatâ€™s it! You can find the URL to your application back under the `Static Website Hosting` tab, labeled `Endpoint`.
1. Open the `Permissions` tab, then select `Edit bucket policy`. Edit bucket policy to allow read-only permissions for anonymous users.


## Jest
Sunrise uses Jest as the test runner. Jest is a Node-based runner in which tests are ran in a node environment instead of a browser environment. This enables fast iteration speed and prevents flakiness.

### Filename Conventions
Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:

* Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.
* Files with `.test.js` suffix.
* Files with `.spec.js` suffix.

It's recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter.

### Running tests
```
$ [npm|yarn] run test
```

### Running tests in `watch` mode
```
$ [npm|yarn] run test -- --watch
```

### Updating snapshots
```
$ [npm|yarn] run test -- --u
```
